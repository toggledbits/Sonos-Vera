# Change Log

## Version 1.4.3 (development)

* rigpapa: Attempt to incorporate, if not literally at least the intent of, all changes since 1.4 (including a somewhat published 1.4.1 and fractionally available parts of the whole).
* rigpapa: Resolve conflicts between Vera Luup's needs and openLuup's needs for TTS (problem noted below with 1.4.1).
* rigpapa: Fix ResponsiveVoiceTTS (2019).
* rigpapa: Fix small issue with MaryTTS.
* rigpapa: In-place fix for non-working JS UI elements; the JS UI needs an upgrade to the "new" (since UI5) JS API--it's still using the ancient approach, but it's still working at the moment. I suspect some upcoming firmware release will force the upgrade.

## Version 1.4.1 (in the wild)

* Released by unknown parties and modified by at least three, this version added ResponsiveVoiceTTS and also attempted some fixes/upgrades for openLuup, but the version of code I had would not allow TTS on Vera (at odds with openLuup changes).

## Version 1.4 (released)

* This is the last version released by lolodomo; original code is (here)[http://code.mios.com/trac/mios_sonos-wireless-music-systems].
