As of 1.4.3-19191, these icon files are not used. Most users will no
longer need to install these. Icons are now derived from the player
itself, which has it in firmware, and the device UI is customized
by the plugin to use the correct icon for the device. This means that
any new players released by Sonos will immediately display the correct
icon, without modification of the plugin, as long as the new player's
firmware continues to include the icon embedded.
